# Homework 4: Sequential Logic
#### Objective
Build all the chips described in the chapter. The only building blocks that you
can use are primitive DFF gates, chips that you will build on top of them, and
chips described in previous chapters.

#### Resources
The only tool that you need for this project is the hardware simulator supplied
with the book. All the chips should be implemented in the HDL language specified
in appendix A. For each one of the chips mentioned in the chapter, we provide a
skeletal .hdl program (text file) with a missing implementation part. In
addition, for each chip we provide a .tst script file that tells the hardware
simulator how to test it, along with the correct output file that this script
should generate, called .cmp or "compare file." Your job is to complete the
missing implementation parts of the supplied .hdl programs.

#### Contract
When loaded into the hardware simulator, your chip design (modified .hdl
program), tested on the supplied .tst file, should produce the outputs listed in
the supplied .cmp file. If that is not the case, the simulator will let you
know.
