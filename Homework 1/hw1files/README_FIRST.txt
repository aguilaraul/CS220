HOMEWORK #1 README
=============================================

FILES PROVIDED IN THIS ZIP:
-	documentation.xml
		use as a super template (has more filled out than
		documentation_temp.xml) to get started easier with
		the documentation. Helps show you expectations of
		good documentation. Open this file in http://draw.io only!
-	Homework01.pdf
		handout with details on what homework entails,
		where points are assigned, and what you should turn
		in.
-	AndDev/NotDev/OrDev/XorDev folders
		As seen in class, separating a chip and all of its files
		away from the rest allows you to use the built-in chips
		for instead of your files.  This will ensure that each
		chip is working on its own, without relying on any of
		your chips, which may contain errors.
-	SUBMIT_ME folder (empty!)
		When you are done with a chip (supposed And.hdl inside
		of AndDev you got working), copy the HDL file over to
		this folder.  This will ensure that you are staying
		organized as you are working through each chip.
		
UPON COMPLETION OF ALL CHIPS/READY TO SUBMIT:
-	Make sure that all of your HDL files that are required/attempted
	are placed inside the SUBMIT_ME folder (And.hdl, Or.hdl, Not.hdl,
	and Xor.hdl for this homework).  You must also have the
	documentation.pdf (MUST be named exactly like that!) in the folder.
-	Navigate to the SUBMIT_ME folder, and select all of the above
	files described (NOT the SUBMIT_ME folder itself, the files inside!)
	-	On Windows, right click on the selected files and choose
		Send to, then select Compressed (zipped) folder, which will
		create a ZIP file for you
	-	On Mac OS X, right click on the selected files and choose
		"Compress 5 items", it will create an Archive.zip file
-	Rename the ZIP file according to the Project Submission Guidelines
-	Upload to Blackboard BEFORE deadline



LASTLY:
Future homeworks will work similarly, but you may not be provided with
this breakdown, just the scripts/comparison/hdl files.  You are expected
to submit the same way and the same quality of work, whether you choose
to follow this process is up to you, but the hope is you stay organized
and work efficiently to complete the homeworks to the best of your
abilities, documented professionally, and submitted in a timely manner.
