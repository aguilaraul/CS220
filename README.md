# CS220-HW-Projects
Homework and projects built during CS220 Fall 2018.

Following along with *The Elements of Computing Systems* and https://www.nand2tetris.org/

**Homework 1:** Basic Logic Gates

Build some of the logic gates described in Chapter 1, yielding a basic
chip-set. The only building blocks that you can use in this project are primitive Nand gates and
the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them.

**Homework 2:** Intermediate Logic Gates

Build the rest of the logic gates described in Chapter 1, yielding a
complete basic chip-set. The only building blocks that you can use in this project are primitive
Nand gates and the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them in the last
homework and this homework.

**Homework 3:** Combinational Chips (Arithmetic + Logic Unit)

Build the gates described in Chapter 2 (see table below), which will test your
understanding of Boolean Logic and Arithmetic, building the gates that do so.

**Homework 4:** Sequential Chips

Build all gates described in Chapter 3 (see table below), which will test your
understanding of sequential chips for our HACK architecture.

**Homework 5:** Machine Language

Build the two Assembly Language programs described in Chapter 4, which will test your
understanding of Assembly programs for our HACK architecture.
