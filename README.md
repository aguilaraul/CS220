# CS220-HW-Projects
Homework and projects built during CS220 Fall 2018.

Following along with *The Elements of Computing Systems* and https://www.nand2tetris.org/

**Homework 1:** Basic Logic Gates

Build some of the logic gates described in Chapter 1, yielding a basic
chip-set. The only building blocks that you can use in this project are primitive Nand gates and
the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them.

**Homework 2:** Intermediate Logic Gates

Build the rest of the logic gates described in Chapter 1, yielding a
complete basic chip-set. The only building blocks that you can use in this project are primitive
Nand gates and the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them in the last
homework and this homework.
